**PS4:** Due Sat Nov 2 at 5:00PM Central. Worth 100 points. 
We use (`*`) to indicate a problem that we think might be time consuming. 
    
## Style Points (10 pts) 
Please refer to the minilesson on code style
**[here](https://uchicago.zoom.us/rec/share/pG_wQ-pHTQrJTmqNn4rcrw5V194M2H2s-2jdy8oVhWHkd_yZt9o162IWurpA-fxU.BIQlSgZLRYctvzp-)**.

## Submission Steps (10 pts)
1. This problem set is a paired problem set.
2. Play paper, scissors, rock to determine who goes first. Call that person *Partner 1*.
    - Partner 1 (Nasser Alshaya and alshaya):
    - Partner 2 (name and cnet ID):
3. Partner 1 will accept the `ps4` and then share the link it creates with their partner. You can only share it with one partner so you will not be able to change it after your partner has accepted. 
4. "This submission is our work alone and complies with the 30538 integrity policy." Add your initials to indicate your agreement: \*\*\NA\*\* \*\*\_\_\*\*
5. "I have uploaded the names of anyone else other than my partner and I worked with on the problem set **[here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/185usrCREQaUbvAXpWhChkjghdGgmAZXA3lPWpXLLsts/edit)**"  (1 point)
6. Late coins used this pset: \*\*\_\_\*\* Late coins left after submission: \*\*\_\_\*\*
7. Knit your `ps4.qmd` to an PDF file to make `ps4.pdf`, 
    * The PDF should not be more than 25 pages. Use `head()` and re-size figures when appropriate. 
8. (Partner 1): push  `ps4.qmd` and `ps4.pdf` to your github repo.
9. (Partner 1): submit `ps4.pdf` via Gradescope. Add your partner on Gradescope.
10. (Partner 1): tag your submission in Gradescope

**Important:** Repositories are for tracking code. **Do not commit the data or shapefiles to your repo.** The best way to do this is with `.gitignore`, which we have covered in class. If you do accidentally commit the data, Github has a [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github#removing-files-from-a-repositorys-history). The best course of action depends on whether you have pushed yet. This also means that both partners will have to download the initial raw data and any data cleaning code will need to be re-run on both partners' computers. 

## Download and explore the Provider of Services (POS) file (10 pts)

1. I pulled the columns related to: Provider Subtype, Provider Type, Number of Times of Changing Ownership, Effective Date of Most Recent Ownership Change, City Name, Facility Name, CMS Certification Number, Termination Status, Date the provider was Terminated, and Zip Code.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import os
base_path = r"/Users/nasser.alshaya/Desktop/problem-set-4-nasser-daniel/POS"
path_data = os.path.join(base_path,"pos2016.csv")
df = pd.read_csv(path_data)
df.columns
```
```{python}
df_2016 = df[
    (df["PRVDR_CTGRY_SBTYP_CD"] == 1) & 
    (df["PRVDR_CTGRY_CD"] == 1)]
len(df_2016)
```

3. The number of short-term hospitals per is plotted below, the number of hospitals increases every year, starting from 7245 in 2016 reaching to 7303 in 2019. 
```{python}
path_data = os.path.join(base_path,
 "pos2017.csv")
df_2017 = pd.read_csv(path_data)
 
path_data = os.path.join(base_path,
 "pos2018.csv")
df_2018 = pd.read_csv(path_data, encoding_errors = "ignore")

path_data = os.path.join(base_path,
 "pos2019.csv")
df_2019 = pd.read_csv(path_data, encoding_errors = "ignore")
```


```{python}
df_2017 = df_2017[
    (df_2017["PRVDR_CTGRY_SBTYP_CD"] == 1) & 
    (df_2017["PRVDR_CTGRY_CD"] == 1)]

df_2018 = df_2018[
    (df_2018["PRVDR_CTGRY_SBTYP_CD"] == 1) & 
    (df_2018["PRVDR_CTGRY_CD"] == 1)]

df_2019 = df_2019[
    (df_2019["PRVDR_CTGRY_SBTYP_CD"] == 1) & 
    (df_2019["PRVDR_CTGRY_CD"] == 1)]

# Add year column for each df for plot:
df_2016["year"] = 2016
df_2017["year"] = 2017
df_2018["year"] = 2018
df_2019["year"] = 2019
df_pos = pd.concat([df_2016,df_2017,df_2018,df_2019],
 ignore_index = True)
```

```{python}
import altair as alt
import warnings 
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
alt.renderers.enable("png")
alt.data_transformers.disable_max_rows()
bars = alt.Chart(df_pos).mark_bar().encode(
    alt.X("year:N", title = "Year"),
    alt.Y("count()",title = None, axis = None)
).properties(
    title = "Number of Short-term Hospitals per Year",
    width = 350, height = 200)
text = bars.mark_text(
    align="center",
    baseline="bottom",
    dy=-5  
).encode(
    text=alt.Text("count():Q")  
)

bars + text
```

4. 
    a. Upon aggregating the data based on the CMS certificate of each hospital, it seems that the numbers are identical to what previously found in (3)

```{python}
bars = alt.Chart(df_pos).transform_aggregate(
    unique_hospitals="count(PRVDR_NUM)",groupby=["year"]
    ).mark_bar().encode(
        x=alt.X("year:N", title="Year"),
    y=alt.Y("unique_hospitals:Q", axis = None, title = None)
).properties(
    title="Count of Unique Hospitals per Year",
    width=350,
    height=200
)
text = bars.mark_text(
    align="center",
    baseline="bottom",
    dy=-5  
).encode(
    text=alt.Text("unique_hospitals:Q")  
)

bars + text
```

    b. Upon comparing the two plots, the number of hospitals per year is identical to the number of unique hospitals based on the CMS certificate, this tells us that the data is strucutured in a way that prevents duplicate entries of hospitals per year, and the records are well strucutured to represent the number of hospitals accurately.

  

## Identify hospital closures in POS file (15 pts) (*)

1. There are `69` hospitals that fit the definition of suspected closure. A sorted list based on their names for the first 10 hospitals is shown below.
```{python}
suspected_hospitals = []

for year in range(2016, 2020):
    for hospital in df_pos["FAC_NAME"].unique():
        df_hospital_year = df_pos[(df_pos["FAC_NAME"] == hospital) & 
        (df_pos["year"] == year)]

        for i in range(len(df_hospital_year) - 1):
            if (df_hospital_year.iloc[i]["PGM_TRMNTN_CD"] == 0).any():
                if (df_hospital_year.iloc[i+1]["PGM_TRMNTN_CD"] != 0 |
                    pd.isna(df_hospital_year.iloc[i + 1]["PGM_TRMNTN_CD"])).any():
                    suspected_hospitals.append(hospital)
                    break
```
```{python}
df_suspected = df_pos[df_pos["FAC_NAME"].isin(suspected_hospitals)]
```

```{python}
df_suspected = df_suspected.groupby("FAC_NAME")[["ZIP_CD","PGM_TRMNTN_CD",
"PRVDR_NUM","year"]].apply(pd.DataFrame).reset_index()
```

```{python}
df_suspected_grouped = df_suspected.groupby("FAC_NAME").agg(
    ZIP_CD = ("ZIP_CD", "first"),
    Closure_year = ("year", "first")
).reset_index()
```

```{python}
# Number of suspected hospitals based on zip code
len(df_suspected_grouped)
```

2. Facility names of suspected closure hospitals sorted by name for the first 10 results:

```{python}
df_suspected_grouped.sort_values(by = "FAC_NAME").head(10)
```

3. 
    a. There are `49` hospitals that fit this definition of potentially
        being a merger/acquisition

```{python}
# Filter df_pos to include only active hospitals
suspected_merger = df_pos[df_pos["PGM_TRMNTN_CD"] != 0]

# Aggregate by year and zip codes
Active_hospitals = df_pos[df_pos["PGM_TRMNTN_CD"] == 0].groupby(
    ["year","ZIP_CD"])["PGM_TRMNTN_CD"].size().reset_index(name = "Active_count")

# Merging both datasets to compare counts
comparison_1 = suspected_merger.merge(
    Active_hospitals,left_on = "ZIP_CD", right_on = "ZIP_CD",
    suffixes =("_closure", "_active"))
# Creating a column for next year counts for comparison 
comparison_1["next_year"] = comparison_1["year_closure"].astype(int) + 1

# Getting active counts for next year
next_year_counts = Active_hospitals.rename(columns={"year": "next_year", "active_count": "next_year_active_count"})
# Comparing for next year
comparison_2 = comparison_1.merge(
    next_year_counts, left_on=["ZIP_CD", "next_year"], 
    right_on=["ZIP_CD", "next_year"], how="left")

# Sorting to include only non decreasing zips
non_decreasing = (
    comparison_2[comparison_2["Active_count_y"] >= comparison_2["Active_count_x"]])
```

```{python}
suspected_zips = set(df_pos["ZIP_CD"].unique()) - set(
    non_decreasing["ZIP_CD"].unique())

# Compare suspected zips with df_suspected group from 2.1
potential_merger = df_suspected_grouped[
    df_suspected_grouped["ZIP_CD"].isin(suspected_zips)]
len(potential_merger)
```

    b. Upon correcting we have 10480 hospitals left in total and 20 closed hospitals

```{python}
len(non_decreasing)
```

```{python}
corrected_closure = df_suspected_grouped[-df_suspected_grouped[
    "ZIP_CD"].isin(suspected_zips)]
len(corrected_closure)
```

    c.

```{python}
corrected_closure.sort_values(by = "FAC_NAME").head(10)
```

len(cleaned_pos_2016[cleaned_pos_2016["ZIP_CD"].isin(texas_zips)])
```

```{python}
# create a list of filtered zips to compare with Texas zips in shp file

# Boolean column to flag hospitals
texas_zip_codes["Hospital_zips"] = texas_zip_codes["ZCTA5"].isin(
    filtered_zips_2016).astype(int)

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
texas_zip_codes.plot(column = "Hospital_zips", linewidth=0.2)
